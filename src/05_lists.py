"""
we have two ways of iterating through a list.

Method 1 - for item in list:

for item in list:
  print item
Method 2 - iterate through indexes:

for i in range(len(list)):
  print list[i]
Method 1 is useful to loop through the list, but itâ€™s not possible to modify the list this way.

Method 2 uses indexes to loop through the list, making it possible to also modify the list if needed. 

Lists of lists
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

for lst in list_of_lists:
  for item in lst:
    print item
